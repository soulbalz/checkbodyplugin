### Issues

The following are all great reasons to submit an issue:

1. You found a bug in the code.
2. Something is missing from the documentation or the existing documentation is unclear.
3. You have an idea for a new feature.

If you are thinking about submitting an issue please remember to:

1. Describe the issue in detail.
2. If applicable, describe the steps to reproduce the error, which probably should include some example code.
3. Mention details about your platform: OS, version of Go and Redis, etc.

### Pull Requests

Fork the repository.
Create a new "feature branch" with a descriptive name (e.g. fix-database-error).
